## Support
For support please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/LMBishop/Quests/issues) or join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/8amrJnX). Please provide information of the issue, any errors that may come up and make sure you are using the latest version of the plugin.

### Issue Tracker
**This is the perferred method of bug reporting & feature requests**. Please use one of the two templates which are provided. If it is neither a bug report or a feature request and is a question, Discord would be a better place to asked this instead. **Follow the template in the issue tracker**. There is nothing more frustrating than people not reporting a bug correctly by missing out vital steps to reproduce the bug or an incomplete description. If the issue is not correctly formated, it will be closed and ignored.

### Discord
**This is the perferred method for general questions about Quests or the development of the project**. Join the Discord server and go to the relative support channel (in this case: #quests-support). Please provide steps to reproduce and a good enough description of the bug and include any errors you may see in console.

### Language
Please speak English and do not use any vulgar or harmful language. Insulting myself or any other contributors will lead to you being blocked, please remember this is a *voulenteer driven project*.

## Configuration Assistance
The configuration documentation can be found at the [wiki](https://github.com/LMBishop/Quests/wiki/Creating-A-Quest-Or-Category).

## Developing Alongside Quests
Creating new Task Types within Quests is supported, [see the wiki](https://github.com/LMBishop/Quests/wiki/New-Task-Type) for help.
